 Once again, Facebook data of millions of users were left exposed in public, which could have been accessed by anyone. In a new privacy breach, over 540 million records of Facebook data including accounts names, likes, comments, as well as FB IDs were found exposed on Amazon's Cloud  servers, cybersecurity firm UpGuard Cyber Risk reported.<br>
 Data from a different third-party app called 'At the pool', which was integrated into Facebook, was also left unexposed as well on Amazon's  servers. The data included passwords of close to 22,000 users stored in plain text.<br>
 Though the firm speculates the passwords are not of Facebook, but 'At the pool' account of users, people who tend to use the same passwords     across their multiple social media accounts may have been exposed. The app shut operations in 2014.
