 <h1>Home page</h1>
 <p class=one> <b><u>Website home page:</u> </b> </br> A home page is generally the main page a visitor navigating to a website from a web   search engine will see, and it may also serve as a landing page to attract visitors.The home page is used to facilitate navigation to other pages on the site by providing links to prioritized and recent articles and pages, and possibly a search box.For example, a news website may present headlines and first paragraphs of top stories, with links to full articles, in a dynamic web page that reflects the popularity and recentness of stories. Meanwhile, other websites use the home page to attract users to create an account. Once they are logged in, the home page may be redirected to their profile page. This may in turn be referred to as the "personal home page".<br>
A website may have multiple home pages, although most have one.Wikipedia, for example, has a home page at wikipedia.org, as well as language-specific home pages, such as en.wikipedia.org and de.wikipedia.org.</p> 
 <p class=second><b> <u>Browser home page</u> </b> </br>
 A home page also refers to the first page that appears upon opening a web browser, sometimes called the start page, although the home page of a website can be used as a start page. This start page can be a website, or it can be a page with various browser functions such as the display of thumbnails of frequently visited websites. Multiple websites can be set as a start page, to open in different tabs. Some websites are intended to be used as start pages, such as iGoogle (now defunct), My Yahoo!, and MSN.com, and provide links to commonly used services such as webmail and online weather forecasts.</p>
 <p class=three><b> <u> History of home pages</u> </b></br>
 In the early days of the World Wide Web in the first half of the 1990s, an important part of web pages belonged to students or teachers with a  UNIX account in their university. System administrators of such systems installed an HTTP server pointing its root directory to the directory containing the users accounts.</p>
